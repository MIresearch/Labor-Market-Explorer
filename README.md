<H2><b>US Labor Market Explorer</b></H2>  <Hr>

The <b> Labor Market Explorer </b> is a set of dynamic and interactive maps combining information at the metropolitan-areas and county levels. As a result, the users can:
<br><b>1-> track the employment changes across eight major economic sectors </b> (education and health services, financial activities, government, information, leisure and hospitality, manufacturing, professional and business services, and trade, transportation, and utilities) for a specific metropolitan area
<br> <b>2 -> look at the behavioral, demographic, economic, and social profile of its population based on the <a href="https://miresearch.github.io/Community-Explorer/" target="_blank"> Community Explorer </a></b> <br><br>
The maps show the evolution of the employment, monthly and yearly changes, since January 2020. They also indicate the governing party of the area and provide updates on state lockdown, and stay-at-home orders, and indoor mask mandates. The information can be filtered by the 8 county-profiles dedined in the <a href="https://miresearch.github.io/Community-Explorer/" target="_blank"> Community Explorer </a>.

 <H2> Community Explorer </H2> <Hr>
The <b>Community Explorer</b> identifies the different populations or communities based on their behavioral, demographic, economic, and social profiles.<br>
  <br> Using machine learning techniques, the counties are clustered into <b>8 community profiles</B>:
 <br><b>1</b> - the most ethnically diverse community with the highest income level. It is a highly educated cohort that resides in large metro areas. (38% US population)
<br><b>2</b> - highly educated, economically prosperous, mostly White counties in metro areas. (25% US population)
<br><b>3</b> - the largest Black population, whose income is the lowest income of all the profiles. These counties are primarily concentrated in the south-east. (12% US population)
<br><b>4</b> - the largest white population with the lowest income of all the profiles. It encompasses mostly rural counties in the East North Central, and Northeast regions. (7% US population))
<br><b>5</b> - predominantly White counties whose economy depends mostly on manufacturing and are located around the Midwest region. (6% US population) 
<br><b>6</b> - the youngest cohort of the profiles, with the largest Hispanic population, the least education level, access to healthy food, and health insurance. The counties are concentrated in the West and West South-Central regions.  (5% US population)
<br><b>7</b> - the oldest cohort of the profiles and consists of mostly White, elderly retirement communities. (4% US population)
<br><b>8</b> - the most rural cohort made of an older White population with the most limited access to healthy food of all the profiles. The counties are mostly in the north part of the West, Midwest, and Northeast regions. (3% US population)<br>
