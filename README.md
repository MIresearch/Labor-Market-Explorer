<H2><b>US Labor Market Explorer</b></H2>  <Hr>

The <b> Labor Market Explorer </b> is a set of dynamic and interactive maps combining information at the metropolitan-areas and county levels. As a result, the users can:
<br><b>1-> track the employment changes across eight major economic sectors </b> (education and health services, financial activities, government, information, leisure and hospitality, manufacturing, professional and business services, and trade, transportation, and utilities) for a specific metropolitan area
<br> <b>2 -> look at the behavioral, demographic, economic, and social profile of its population based on the <a href="https://miresearch.github.io/Community-Explorer/" target="_blank"> Community Explorer </a></b> <br><br>
The maps show the evolution of the employment, monthly and yearly changes, since January 2020. The information can be filtered by the 17 county-profiles defined by the <a href="https://miresearch.github.io/Community-Explorer-17-profiles/" target="_blank"> Community Explorer </a>.
